This web application was created to serve as a simple scheduling tool. The inspiration behind its development was my mother's expressed dislike for having to manually organize her schedule. In response, I designed this app to operate on a local level, storing all data directly on each machine that accesses it.

The application provides users with the ability to effortlessly create, manage, and delete events within their schedule. Furthermore, users have the option to download their schedule in a convenient .txt file format.

One noteworthy feature of the app is its ability to detect overlapping events. In instances where a user attempts to schedule an event that conflicts with an existing one, the application issues a prompt to alert the user, preventing inadvertent scheduling conflicts. This ensures a smoother and more organized scheduling experience for the user.
